These projects explores the foundational concepts and usage of Data Analysis Expressions (DAX) in Power BI and other Microsoft data platforms. 

The goal is to understand how DAX queries can be used to perform basic data manipulation, aggregation, and analysis within data models.

Through practical examples, the project demonstrates how to create calculated columns, measures, and tables using DAX functions, 
empowering users to extract valuable insights from their data.
